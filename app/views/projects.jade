            | This particular site is an ongoing project for me.
            | I adapted the original django site into this node/express version recently for the sake of curiousity.  
            | There are some things I'd like to try with node that wouldn't have been as easy in django. 
            | For example, I'm able to try html/css things out much quicker with jade.

            | Inspired by a school project where we wrote a chat server with cgi and udp sockets, 
            | I wanted to see how easy it was to get the same functionality with node.

          h4 Socket Programming for Networks 4211

          p
            | Fall semester of 2012 I finished a Networks project involving sockets which I wrote in Python.
            | This assignment was an 'atm' middleman which handled client transactions and handed them off to the bank server.  
            | I used select in python which is essentially the same as the equivalent C function to asynchronously 
            | handle up an arbitrary amount of client connections while the bank server will handle all the atm requested transactions. 
            | More details in the readme.md in the repo.

          h4 Python send_to_kindle script
          p
            | The lack of a send_to_kindle for linux surprised me.. 
            | So I wrote a simple python script to send your ebooks to your kindle via the user@kindle.com email address
