## Project Bootstrapping!

You can now use this template to bootstrap a reflex project. It uses stack for dependencies and provides a small core module along with a baseline Model/View/Update logic.

You can use it now if you have [hi](https://github.com/fujimura/hi) installed.

```
hi some_project --repository git://github.com/tippenein/haskeleton-reflex.git
cd some_project
make
```

You can look further at how it's set up [here](https://github.com/tippenein/haskeleton-reflex/tree/master/package-name)

## Other options

The [reflex-platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform) is the official way supported by reflex for development, so this project is for people who want a reference on a working Stack config or people who are simply too stubborn to move to nix.
