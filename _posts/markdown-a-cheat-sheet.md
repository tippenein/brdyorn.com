Until you find yourself using markdown frequently, it's hard to remember the syntax, so I'm compiling a list of the mistakes I usually made/make.
[daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) was where I looked first, however it has _everything_


Blockquotes simply use '>' and can contain anything you'd usually use (ex. ##, ===, etc)

Links use square-brackets for the links name and parens for the href with an optional title 'argument'

    [anchor name](http://www.link.com "title")

That would give you <pre><a href="http://www.link.com" title="title">anchor name</a></pre>

> Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens — interchangably — as list markers
