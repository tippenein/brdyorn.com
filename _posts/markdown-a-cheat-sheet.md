Until you find yourself using markdown frequently, it's hard to remember the syntax, so I'm compiling a list of the mistakes I usually made/make.
[Daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) was where I looked first, however it has _everything_, which can be overwelming.

- Blockquotes simply use '>' and can contain anything you'd usually use (ex. ##, ===, etc)  
- Links use square-brackets for the links name and parens for the href with an optional title 'argument' `[anchor name](http://www.link.com "title")`  
- Unordered lists use * + or - 
- a code block uses ` ` ` (backticks)
On the right side of [this page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) you'll find a similar rundown of markdown
